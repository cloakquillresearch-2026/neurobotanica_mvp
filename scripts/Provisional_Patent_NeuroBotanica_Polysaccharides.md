## Abstract

A computational platform and methods for predicting therapeutic synergies across multiple botanical kingdoms, specifically extending from cannabis dimeric compounds to polysaccharide combinations including marine polysaccharides, fungal beta-glucans, and herbal mucilages. The platform uses unified computational workflows to predict synergistic effects, mechanisms, and therapeutic properties before physical testing, enabling accelerated development of botanical therapeutics with regulatory compliance documentation.

## Detailed Description

### Background of the Invention

Botanical therapeutics have historically been developed through trial-and-error approaches, requiring extensive laboratory testing and clinical trials. Traditional methods are time-consuming and expensive, often taking 5-7 years and costing millions of dollars per compound. This is particularly challenging for complex multi-compound formulations where synergistic effects are difficult to predict.

The present invention builds upon the NeuroBotanica platform disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. [to be assigned], filed December 22, 2025, which focused on dimeric cannabinoid prediction. This application extends those methods to cross-kingdom botanical synergies, particularly polysaccharide combinations from marine, fungal, and plant sources.

### Field of the Invention

The invention relates to computational methods and platforms for predicting therapeutic synergies in botanical compounds, specifically polysaccharides from multiple kingdoms, using artificial intelligence, systems biology, and chemistry modeling.

### Summary of the Invention

The invention provides a computational platform that predicts therapeutic compound synergies across four botanical kingdoms: Cannabis, Marine Polysaccharides, Fungal Polysaccharides, and Plant Polysaccharides. The platform uses unified algorithmic workflows with domain-specific parameter libraries to process both small molecules and macromolecules.

Key aspects include:
- Prediction of polysaccharide synergies based on structural characterization
- Modeling of gastrointestinal conditions and biological interactions
- Generation of therapeutic property predictions and mechanisms
- Automatic regulatory documentation for dietary supplements
- Optional integration of traditional knowledge with consent

### Detailed Description of the Invention

#### Platform Architecture

The NeuroBotanica platform comprises:

1. **Input Module**: Accepts polysaccharide structural data including:
   - Glycosyl composition (monosaccharide ratios)
   - Molecular weight distribution
   - Sulfation/acetylation patterns
   - Branching degrees

2. **Computational Engine**: Unified workflow that:
   - Builds 3D structural models
   - Predicts synergistic interactions
   - Models biological conditions (pH, enzymes, microbiome)
   - Calculates therapeutic scores and mechanisms

3. **Output Module**: Generates:
   - Synergy predictions with confidence intervals
   - Regulatory documentation
   - Patent novelty assessments
   - Traditional knowledge validations

#### Polysaccharide Synergy Prediction Workflow

**Step 1: Input Polysaccharide Structures**

Researchers input characterization data from analytical methods:
- SEC-MALLS for molecular weight
- GC-MS for glycosyl composition
- FTIR for functional groups
- ζ-potential for surface charge

**Step 2: Specify Biological Conditions**

Users define gastrointestinal or physiological conditions:
- pH gradients (stomach to intestine)
- Enzymatic environments
- Transit times
- Microbiome contexts

**Step 3: Synergy Calculation**

The platform calculates:
- Combined effects (viscosity, bioavailability)
- Mechanism predictions (complementary gelation, receptor co-activation)
- Therapeutic enhancements
- Confidence intervals

#### Cross-Kingdom Applications

**Marine Polysaccharides:**
- Fucoidan, carrageenan, chitosan, alginate
- Applications: anticancer, anticoagulant, neuroprotective

**Fungal Beta-Glucans:**
- Beta-1,3-glucans from medicinal mushrooms
- Applications: immune modulation, neuroinflammation reduction

**Herbal Mucilages:**
- Pectin, galactomannan, aloe polysaccharides
- Applications: drug delivery, glycemic control

**Cross-Kingdom Synergy:**
- Combinations across kingdoms for enhanced effects
- Complementary mechanisms for superior performance

#### Technical Implementation

The platform is implemented as:
- SaaS web application
- RESTful API for integration
- Cloud-based computational resources
- Database of polysaccharide structures and traditional knowledge

#### Regulatory Compliance

- Generates GRAS notifications for dietary supplements
- FDA-ready documentation packages
- Traditional knowledge attribution systems
- Patent prior art searches
