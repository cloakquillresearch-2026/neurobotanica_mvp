## ABSTRACT

A computational platform and methods for predicting therapeutic synergies across multiple botanical kingdoms, specifically combining cannabis-derived compounds with marine polysaccharides (fucoidans, carrageenans, chitosans), fungal beta-glucans (medicinal mushroom extracts), and plant-derived mucilages (herbal polysaccharides). The platform employs unified computational workflows with domain-specific parameter libraries to model polysaccharide structures, predict synergistic interactions based on complementary receptor targeting, and generate therapeutic formulations optimized for neuropsychiatric disorders. The system incorporates demographic bias correction algorithms accounting for genetic polymorphisms in polysaccharide-metabolizing enzymes (fucosidases, Dectin-1 variants) and generates regulatory-compliant documentation for dietary supplement applications. Traditional knowledge validation modules correlate predicted synergies with multi-cultural botanical practices, providing evidence-based support for novel cross-kingdom combinations while ensuring appropriate attribution and benefit-sharing with knowledge-contributing communities.

**Field of Invention:** Computational chemistry, botanical therapeutics, systems biology, artificial intelligence for drug discovery, polysaccharide therapeutics, demographic pharmacogenomics

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### 1.1 Challenges in Botanical Therapeutic Development

Botanical therapeutics have historically been developed through empirical trial-and-error approaches requiring extensive laboratory testing, animal studies, and clinical trials. Traditional development pathways are time-consuming (5-10 years) and expensive ($5M-50M per approved therapeutic), creating significant barriers to translating traditional botanical knowledge into evidence-based medicine.

Multi-compound botanical formulations present even greater challenges due to:
- Complex synergistic interactions difficult to predict a priori
- Lack of systematic methods for cross-kingdom botanical combinations
- Individual variability in therapeutic response due to genetic polymorphisms
- Regulatory requirements for safety and efficacy documentation
- Intellectual property challenges in protecting multi-component natural products

### 1.2 Limitations of Current Approaches

Existing computational approaches for botanical therapeutic development focus primarily on:
1. **Single-compound screening**: High-throughput screening of isolated compounds, missing synergistic effects
2. **Single-kingdom approaches**: Cannabis-only, mushroom-only, or seaweed-only platforms without cross-kingdom optimization
3. **Generic formulations**: Lack of demographic-specific optimization accounting for metabolic enzyme variants
4. **Limited predictive accuracy**: Insufficient integration of structural chemistry, receptor binding, and systems biology

No existing platform combines:
- Multi-kingdom botanical optimization (cannabis + marine + fungal + plant)
- Polysaccharide structural characterization and synergy prediction
- Demographic bias correction for personalized therapeutic predictions
- Traditional knowledge validation with appropriate attribution systems
- Automated regulatory documentation generation

### 1.3 Recent Advances in Biosynthetic Engineering

Recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of engineering botanical biosynthetic pathways for heterologous production of therapeutic compounds. Villard et al. (2025) used ancestral sequence reconstruction to demonstrate that early cannabinoid oxidocyclases were promiscuous enzymes producing multiple cannabinoids (THCA, CBDA, CBCA) from a single precursor (cannabigerolic acid). Modern specialized enzymes evolved through gene duplication and subfunctionalization. Critically, ancestral and hybrid engineered enzymes showed superior heterologous expression compared to modern specialized variants, enabling yeast- or bacteria-based production of cannabinoids with custom product distributions (*Plant Biotechnol J.* doi: 10.1111/pbi.70475).

Similar promiscuous ancestor approaches have been demonstrated for terpene synthases in marine organisms, alkaloid biosynthesis in medicinal plants, and polyketide synthases in fungi, suggesting broad applicability of ancestral enzyme engineering for therapeutic natural product optimization.

However, these advances focus exclusively on biosynthetic pathway engineering within single kingdoms. No prior art extends biosynthetic engineering principles to **cross-kingdom therapeutic optimization** combining multiple botanical sources (cannabis, marine, fungal, plant) into synergistic multi-compound formulations.

### 1.4 Polysaccharide Therapeutic Potential

Marine, fungal, and plant polysaccharides represent a largely untapped class of therapeutic compounds with:

**Marine Polysaccharides:**
- Fucoidans (sulfated fucose-rich): Anticoagulant, anticancer, neuroprotective
- Carrageenans (sulfated galactans): Anti-inflammatory, antiviral, immunomodulatory
- Chitosan (deacetylated chitin): Drug delivery, antimicrobial, wound healing
- Alginates (mannuronic/guluronic acids): Gastric protection, heavy metal chelation

**Fungal Beta-Glucans:**
- β-1,3 and β-1,6 linkages from *Hericium*, *Ganoderma*, *Cordyceps*
- Dectin-1 receptor activation → immune modulation
- Neuroinflammation reduction, neurogenesis induction
- Gut microbiome modulation → gut-brain axis effects

**Plant Mucilages:**
- Arabinogalactans, glucomannans, mixed-linkage glucans
- Viscosity-mediated drug delivery and sustained release
- Prebiotic effects → short-chain fatty acid production
- Glycemic control, satiety enhancement

Recent research on polysaccharide synergies (Srinivasan et al., ACS Omega, 2024) demonstrated that okra and fenugreek polysaccharides achieved 90% microplastic removal through complementary mechanisms: okra's anionic structure performed best in high ionic strength (ocean water), while fenugreek's neutral galactomannans excelled in low ionic strength (groundwater). A 1:1 blend achieved 77% removal with 2x faster kinetics (30 min vs 60 min), demonstrating that **mechanistic complementarity produces superior outcomes vs single-source approaches.**

This principle—complementary mechanisms from different kingdoms producing synergistic effects—has not been applied to therapeutic botanical formulation design.

### 1.5 Need for the Present Invention

There exists an unmet need for:
1. Computational platform predicting cross-kingdom botanical synergies before physical testing
2. Polysaccharide structural characterization methods correlating molecular properties with therapeutic effects
3. Demographic bias correction accounting for genetic variants in polysaccharide metabolism
4. Traditional knowledge validation systems ensuring appropriate attribution
5. Regulatory documentation automation for dietary supplement and pharmaceutical pathways
6. Integration of biosynthetic engineering principles for custom therapeutic production

The present invention addresses these needs through a unified computational platform extending methods disclosed in the related cannabis-focused application (U.S. Provisional filed December 22, 2025) to multi-kingdom botanical polysaccharide combinations.

### 3.3 Computational Workflow: Synergy Prediction

#### Step 1: Polysaccharide Structure Modeling

Platform builds 3D conformational models from analytical data:

```
INPUT: SEC-MALLS data, GC-MS glycosyl composition, FTIR sulfation patterns
↓
Monosaccharide sequence prediction using Markov chain models
↓
3D structure generation via molecular dynamics (GROMACS, AMBER)
↓
Conformational ensemble sampling (100-1000 structures)
↓
Receptor docking calculations (TLR2/4, Dectin-1, selectins)
↓
OUTPUT: Predicted binding affinities (Kd values), interaction energies
```

**Key Innovation:** Unlike prior art requiring full 3D structure determination (NMR, X-ray), platform predicts therapeutic-relevant conformations from routine analytical chemistry data.

#### Step 2: Biological Environment Simulation

Platform models gastrointestinal and systemic conditions:

```
GI Tract Simulation:
├── Gastric phase: pH 1.5-3.5, pepsin activity, 30-90 min residence
├── Intestinal phase: pH 5.5-7.5, pancreatic enzymes, 2-6 hr transit
├── Colonic phase: pH 6.5-7.0, microbiome fermentation, SCFA production
└── Absorption modeling: Mucus layer penetration, M-cell uptake

Systemic Distribution:
├── Blood-brain barrier: P-glycoprotein efflux, tight junction modulation
├── Receptor activation: Dose-response curves for multi-receptor systems
├── Metabolic clearance: Fucosidase, glycosidases, sulfatases
└── Half-life prediction: PK parameters for each component
```

#### Step 3: Synergy Score Calculation

Platform quantifies synergistic effects through:

**Formula:**
```
Synergy_Score = Σ[w_i × (R_combined - R_expected) / R_expected]

Where:
R_combined = Response from multi-compound formulation (measured or predicted)
R_expected = Sum of individual component responses
w_i = Weighting factors for therapeutic objectives (efficacy, safety, tolerability)
```

**Synergy Types Detected:**
1. **Additive (Score: 0.0-0.2):** Combined effect equals sum of parts
2. **Synergistic (Score: >0.2):** Combined effect exceeds sum
3. **Antagonistic (Score: <0.0):** Components interfere with each other

**Multi-Receptor Complementarity Bonus:**
```
If Component A activates CB1/CB2 (cannabis)
AND Component B activates TLR2/4 (fucoidan)
AND Component C activates Dectin-1 (beta-glucan)
AND Component D activates gut-brain axis (mucilage)
→ Complementarity_Bonus = +0.15 to Synergy_Score
```

**Mechanistic Diversity Bonus:**
```
If mechanisms include:
- Anti-inflammatory (cytokine reduction)
- Neuroprotective (antioxidant)
- Neurotransmitter modulation (serotonin, GABA)
- Neurogenesis (BDNF upregulation)
→ Diversity_Bonus = +0.10 to Synergy_Score
```

#### Step 4: Multi-Objective Optimization

Platform uses Pareto frontier analysis to identify optimal formulations:

**Objectives to Maximize:**
- Therapeutic efficacy score (>0.80 target)
- Safety score from ToxPath (>0.90 required)
- Traditional knowledge validation accuracy (>0.75 preferred)
- Predicted patient response rate (>60% for resistant conditions)

**Objectives to Minimize:**
- Manufacturing cost per dose
- Dose frequency (prefer once-daily)
- Pharmacokinetic interference between components
- Receptor overlap (prefer complementary, not redundant)

**Constraints:**
- All components must have GRAS status or approved drug status
- Stability >18 months at room temperature
- No known allergen cross-reactivity
- Clinical precedent in ≥1 botanical medical system

**Output:** Rank-ordered list of formulations on Pareto frontier (typically 10-30 candidates)

### 3.4 Demographic Bias Correction Algorithms

#### 3.4.1 Fucosidase Polymorphism Correction (Marine Polysaccharides)

**Problem:** Fucoidan efficacy depends on gut fucosidase activity, which varies by population:

```
Population-Specific Fucosidase Activity:
East Asian: High activity (α-1,3/1,4 fucosidases common)
European: Moderate activity
African: Lower activity (different microbiome composition)
→ Same fucoidan dose produces 2-3x variable response
```

**Solution:** Platform corrects therapeutic predictions based on genetic markers:

```
IF patient has:
  FUT2 secretor status: Active
  Microbiome α-fucosidase genes: Present (metagenomic data)
THEN:
  Predicted_Response = Baseline × 1.3 (enhanced fucoidan metabolism)
ELSE:
  Predicted_Response = Baseline × 0.7 (reduced metabolism)
  Recommendation: Increase dose by 40% OR add fucosidase supplement
```

#### 3.4.2 Dectin-1 Variant Correction (Fungal Beta-Glucans)

**Problem:** CLEC7A gene (encodes Dectin-1 receptor) has functional polymorphisms:

```
Y238X polymorphism (stop codon):
- Heterozygotes: 30-50% reduced beta-glucan response
- Homozygotes: 70-90% reduced response
- Frequency: 3-8% in European populations, <1% in East Asian

Ile223Ser polymorphism:
- Moderate reduction in binding affinity
- Frequency: 15-25% in European populations
```

**Solution:** Platform adjusts beta-glucan dose predictions:

```
IF patient genotype is:
  CLEC7A Y238X heterozygote:
    Beta_glucan_dose × 1.5 (compensate for reduced receptor)
  CLEC7A Y238X homozygote:
    Consider alternative immune modulator (PSK, PSP)
  CLEC7A Ile223Ser:
    Beta_glucan_dose × 1.2
```

#### 3.4.3 CYP450 Variant Integration (Cannabinoid Metabolism)

**Problem:** Cannabis metabolism varies by CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP2C19 genotypes (disclosed in related provisional application filed December 22, 2025).

**Extension:** Platform integrates cannabinoid PK corrections with polysaccharide PK to avoid drug-drug interactions:

```
IF patient is:
  CYP2C9 poor metabolizer (THC accumulation risk)
  AND taking high-viscosity mucilage (slows absorption)
THEN:
  Risk = THC peak concentration × 1.8 (delayed absorption + slow clearance)
  Recommendation: Reduce THC dose 40%, add CBD for safety
```

#### 3.4.4 Sex Hormone Effects

**Problem:** Estrogen and testosterone influence polysaccharide response:

```
Estrogen Effects:
- Increases TLR4 expression → enhanced fucoidan response
- Modulates gut microbiome → different SCFA production
- Women show 20-30% greater anti-inflammatory response to marine polysaccharides

Testosterone Effects:
- Suppresses TLR4 signaling → reduced fucoidan response
- Men require 15-25% higher doses for equivalent effects
```

**Solution:** Platform provides sex-specific dose recommendations:

```
Female (premenopausal): Fucoidan dose = Baseline × 0.85
Female (postmenopausal): Fucoidan dose = Baseline × 1.0
Male: Fucoidan dose = Baseline × 1.2
```

### 3.5 Traditional Knowledge Validation Module (GenomePath-Extended)

#### 3.5.1 Multi-Cultural Correlation Analysis

Platform validates predicted synergies against traditional botanical practices from ≥3 independent medical systems:

**Medical Systems Queried:**
1. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
2. Ayurvedic Medicine (India)
3. Kampo Medicine (Japan)
4. European Herbal Medicine
5. Indigenous North American practices
6. Indigenous South American practices
7. Traditional Pacific Islander medicine

**Validation Workflow:**
```
INPUT: Predicted formulation (e.g., cannabis + fucoidan + lion's mane + marshmallow)
↓
Search traditional texts for combinations of:
  - Cannabis (psychoactive, pain, digestive)
  - Seaweed/kelp (mineral, thyroid, digestive)
  - Mushrooms (immune, cognitive, energy)
  - Demulcent herbs (soothing, protective, digestive)
↓
Calculate correlation scores:
  - Direct match (same 4 botanicals used together): Score = 1.0
  - 3/4 match + similar indication: Score = 0.75
  - 2/4 match + complementary uses: Score = 0.50
  - Novel combination (no precedent): Score = 0.0
↓
Aggregate across medical systems:
  Validation_Accuracy = Average(correlation_scores)
↓
OUTPUT: Traditional knowledge support level
  >0.85 = Strong multi-cultural precedent
  0.75-0.85 = Moderate precedent
  0.50-0.75 = Partial precedent
  <0.50 = Novel combination (requires additional safety testing)
```

#### 3.5.2 Example: Depression Formulation Validation

**Predicted Formulation:**
```
Component 1: Cannabis (CBD 25mg, THC 5mg, β-caryophyllene 2mg)
Component 2: Fucoidan (300mg, high sulfation)
Component 3: Lion's Mane extract (500mg, 30% polysaccharides)
Component 4: Marshmallow root (400mg mucilage)
```

**Traditional Knowledge Search Results:**
```
TCM:
- Cannabis: Ming Dynasty texts describe use for "stagnant qi" (depression)
- Seaweed: "Kunbu" (kelp) for phlegm, depression, thyroid
- Mushrooms: Not emphasized in classical TCM for depression
- Marshmallow analog: "Bai Ji" (Bletilla) for digestive soothing
- Correlation: 0.75 (3/4 present, depression indication matches)

Ayurveda:
- Cannabis: "Bhang" for anxiety, insomnia, digestive issues
- Seaweed: Limited traditional use (not coastal regions)
- Mushrooms: Limited fungal medicine tradition
- Marshmallow analog: "Yashtimadhu" (licorice) for stress, digestion
- Correlation: 0.50 (2/4 present, related indications)

European Herbal:
- Cannabis: Medieval texts for melancholy, pain
- Seaweed: Coastal communities used for thyroid, mineral deficiency
- Mushrooms: Not traditional (recent adoption from Asia)
- Marshmallow: Classical Greek/Roman for inflammation, digestion
- Correlation: 0.75 (3/4 present, depression/melancholy matches)

Indigenous North American:
- Cannabis: Not native (post-Columbian introduction)
- Seaweed: Pacific Northwest tribes used extensively
- Mushrooms: Limited documented use for mental health
- Marshmallow: Not native (introduced species)
- Correlation: 0.25 (1/4 present, but depression treated with other botanicals)

Overall Validation Accuracy: (0.75 + 0.50 + 0.75 + 0.25) / 4 = 0.5625 (56.3%)
Interpretation: Partial traditional precedent. Individual components well-documented,
but specific 4-way combination is novel. Recommendation: Proceed with formulation
but conduct additional safety testing.
```

#### 3.5.3 Consent and Attribution System

**Integration with CommunityForge (disclosed in separate provisional application):**

  └── Community veto mechanism (60% vote to revoke consent)
  
ELSE:
  Novel_Combination = TRUE
  Standard_IP_Protection = Available (composition of matter claims)
  No_Community_Attribution_Required = TRUE
```

### 3.6 Biosynthetic Production Pathways (Novel Integration)

#### 3.6.1 Engineered Cannabinoid Synthases

Building on ancestral enzyme engineering principles (Villard et al., 2025), platform enables design of custom cannabinoid oxidocyclases for heterologous production:

**Workflow:**
```
Step 1: Specify desired cannabinoid ratios
  Target: 40% THCA, 40% CBDA, 20% CBCA
  (Custom ratio for specific receptor activation profile)

Step 2: Rational mutagenesis design
  Ancestral promiscuous enzyme as starting template
  Key residues: Positions 283, 414, 484 (from Villard et al.)
  Platform predicts mutations for target product distribution:
    F283L + G414S → 42% THCA, 38% CBDA, 20% CBCA (within target)

Step 3: Heterologous host selection
  Options: S. cerevisiae, E. coli, N. benthamiana, algae
  Platform optimizes codon usage for selected host

   - THC dose reduced 30% due to CYP2C9*2/*2 (slower clearance)
   - Myrcene: Sedative terpene potentiating cannabinoid effects
   
2. Fucoidan: 400mg (increased from 300mg baseline)
   - Dose adjustment: +33% due to FUT2 secretor-negative (lower fucosidase)
   - Mechanism: Neuroinflammation, HPA axis modulation
   
3. Reishi extract: 600mg
   - Mechanism: Anxiolytic, sleep quality improvement
   
4. Marshmallow root: 500mg
   - Mechanism: Gut-brain axis, serotonin (daytime anxiety reduction)
   
Synergy Score: 0.71 (strong synergy)
Predicted Efficacy: 69% reduction in PTSD symptoms
Traditional Knowledge Validation: 0.65 (partial precedent - cannabis + mushrooms common)
Safety Score: 0.91

Mechanism Summary:
1. Endocannabinoid system reconsolidation blockade (THC, CBD)
2. Sleep architecture improvement (myrcene, Reishi)
3. Neuroinflammation reduction (fucoidan)
4. HPA axis normalization (Reishi adaptogenic)

Clinical Monitoring:
- PCL-5 (PTSD checklist): Biweekly
- Sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index): Weekly
- Nightmare frequency: Daily log
- THC side effects: Weekly (adjust dose if needed)
```

**Rationale for Demographic Corrections:**
- THC dose reduced 30% because CYP2C9*2/*2 slows metabolism, increasing exposure 1.4-1.6x
- Fucoidan dose increased 33% because FUT2 secretor-negative correlates with lower gut fucosidase activity
- Female patient: TLR4 enhancement reduces fucoidan requirement, offsetting FUT2 effect partially

### Example 4: Pediatric ADHD (Adolescent)

**Clinical Scenario:**
Male adolescent, age 15, mixed ethnicity, ADHD (combined type), stimulant-refractory, family prefers natural approaches.

**Platform Input:**
```
Indication: ADHD (combined type, stimulant-refractory)
Patient demographics: Male, 15 years, mixed ethnicity
Genetic data: Not available (minor, parental consent limited)
Prior treatments: Methylphenidate (ineffective), atomoxetine (side effects)
Family preference: Cannabis-free initially
```

**Platform Output:**
```
Optimized Formulation (Cannabis-Free Starter):
1. Lion's Mane extract: 750mg
   - Mechanism: Cognitive enhancement, dopamine modulation
   - Evidence: Pediatric safety established in Asian traditional use
   
2. Fucoidan: 350mg
   - Mechanism: Neuroinflammation reduction (ADHD neuroinflammatory component)
   
3. Slippery elm (*Ulmus rubra*): 400mg
   - Mechanism: Gut-brain axis, microbiome modulation
   
4. Optional CBD addition after 4-week trial: 15mg CBD (THC-free)
   - If insufficient response to mushroom + polysaccharide base
   - Mechanism: Focus improvement, impulsivity reduction
   
Synergy Score: 0.52 (moderate synergy, conservative for pediatric)
Predicted Efficacy: 58% response rate (lower but acceptable for natural approach)
Traditional Knowledge Validation: 0.88 (strong precedent for mushrooms in pediatric use)
Safety Score: 0.97 (very high due to conservative formulation)

Mechanism Summary:
1. Cognitive enhancement (Lion's Mane NGF stimulation)
2. Neuroinflammation reduction (fucoidan)
3. Gut-brain axis optimization (slippery elm prebiotic effects)

Clinical Monitoring:
- ADHD Rating Scale-5: Weekly for 6 weeks
- Academic performance: Teacher reports monthly
- Sleep quality: Parental report weekly
- GI tolerability: Patient report
- CBD addition consideration: Week 4 evaluation
```

**Rationale:**
- Cannabis-free initial formulation respects family preference and regulatory concerns for minors
- Lion's Mane has extensive traditional pediatric use in TCM and Japanese Kampo
- Conservative dosing with high safety margins
- CBD as optional add-on if response insufficient (requires additional parental consent)

### Example 5: Biosynthetic Production - Custom Cannabinoid Ratio

**Application:** Pharmaceutical company developing novel cannabinoid therapeutic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (negative symptoms).

**Platform Input:**
```
Target indication: Schizophrenia negative symptoms (anhedonia, social withdrawal)
Desired cannabinoid profile: 30% THCV, 50% CBD, 20% CBC
Rationale: THCV (CB1 antagonist), CBD (antipsychotic), CBC (neurogenesis)
Production: Heterologous (yeast-based for beta-glucan co-production)
```

**Platform Output:**
```
Engineered Enzyme Design:
Base: Ancestral cannabinoid oxidocyclase (promiscuous)
Targeted mutations:
- F283W: Shifts THCA → THCV production (+THCV synthase activity)
- G414A: Enhances CBD production
- V484L: Reduces CBC to 20% (vs 30% ancestral)

Predicted Product Distribution:
- THCV: 32% (target 30%, within acceptable range)
- CBD: 48% (target 50%, close)
- CBC: 20% (target 20%, exact)

Heterologous Host: *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (yeast)
Codon optimization: Done (CAI = 0.92 for yeast)
Expected expression: 150-200 mg/L cannabinoid total
Co-produced beta-glucan: 3-5 g/L (native yeast cell wall)

Quality Control Specifications:
- HPLC-UV quantification: Cannabinoid ratios ±5%
- Endotoxin: <0.1 EU/mg (yeast, lower than bacteria)
- Beta-glucan purity: >90% (enzymatic assay)
- Heavy metals: <10 ppm total

Formulation Recommendation:
1. Engineered cannabinoids: 30mg THCV, 50mg CBD, 20mg CBC
2. Co-produced beta-glucan: 500mg (purified from yeast cell wall)
3. Added fucoidan: 300mg (for neuroinflammation)
4. Added marshmallow: 400mg (for gut-brain axis)

Synergy Score: 0.74 (strong synergy)
Predicted Efficacy: 61% improvement in negative symptoms (vs 35% for antipsychotics alone)
Traditional Knowledge: N/A (novel synthetic combination)
Safety Score: 0.93

Regulatory Pathway: Pre-IND for novel botanical drug (FDA 21 CFR 312)
IP Strategy: Method claims (biosynthetic), composition claims (ratio + polysaccharides)
```

**Advantages of Biosynthetic Approach:**
- Precise cannabinoid ratio control (±5% vs ±30% for plant extraction)
- No agricultural variability or pesticide concerns
- Co-production of beta-glucan reduces manufacturing costs
- Scalable to pharmaceutical quantities (100+ kg/year)
- Quality control simpler than multi-source botanical extraction
