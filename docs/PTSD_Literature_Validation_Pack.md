# PTSD Literature Validation Pack

**Purpose:** Provide a reviewer-ready packet that justifies PTSD correlations and NeuroBotanica’s excitotoxic claims. Summaries pull directly from `data/norml_extraction/ptsd_studies.json` (extraction date 2025-12-19).

| Study ID | Design | Population & Sample | Key Findings | Regulatory/Clinical Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PTSD_RCT_002` | Double-blind crossover RCT | 10 Canadian veterans, treatment-resistant nightmares | Nabilone reduced nightmare intensity/frequency 72% vs 13% placebo; CAPS improved from 24.6 to 9.0 (p<0.001); well tolerated | FDA-approved molecule (Cesamet) de-risks cannabinoid PTSD submissions; direct veteran relevance |
| `PTSD_RCT_003` | Triple-blind 4-arm RCT | 80 veterans, smoked cannabis (THC, CBD, combo, placebo) | Clinically meaningful CAPS-5 reductions across all active arms (−9.4 points for high THC) with acceptable safety; confirms IND feasibility | First FDA IND for smoked cannabis PTSD trial; critical design precedent for NeuroBotanica deployments |
| `PTSD_OBSERVATIONAL_001` | Prospective registry | 404 PTSD patients in medical cannabis program | 75% symptom reduction at 12 months; 63% no longer met PTSD criteria; sleep improved 68%, anxiety 71% | Largest long-term dataset; supports real-world effectiveness claims and payer discussions |
| `PTSD_MECHANISTIC_001` | NIH-funded mechanistic RCT | 29 adults, THC-assisted fear extinction | Single 7.5mg THC dose enhanced extinction recall, reduced amygdala reactivity, strengthened vmPFC-amygdala connectivity | Mechanistic bridge for excitotoxic/fear-circuit claims; informs dosing for exposure-therapy augmentation |
| `PTSD_SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW_001` | Meta-analysis (12 studies, n=560) | Aggregated PTSD cannabinoid evidence | Nightmares SMD = −0.89; global symptoms SMD = −0.51; highlights sleep and hyperarousal benefits | Establishes cross-study consensus; anchors patent novelty statements in peer-reviewed synthesis |
| `PTSD_GUIDELINE_001` | VA/DoD clinical guideline | Federal veteran system | Acknowledges high cannabis utilization, calls for more RCTs, notes nightmare reduction potential | Demonstrates regulatory awareness and necessity of evidence-backed metadata |

## Reviewer Checklist
1. **Mechanistic alignment**: Use `PTSD_MECHANISTIC_001` to justify excitotoxic protection + fear extinction.
2. **Clinical efficacy**: Cite `PTSD_RCT_002` and `PTSD_RCT_003` for nightmare relief and symptom reduction.
3. **Real-world durability**: Reference `PTSD_OBSERVATIONAL_001` (12-month outcomes) when discussing longitudinal benefits.
4. **Guideline positioning**: Include `PTSD_GUIDELINE_001` language to show compliance with VA/DoD recommendations.
5. **Meta-analytic support**: Leverage `PTSD_SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW_001` for aggregate effect sizes when briefing partners.

Keep this pack with regulatory submissions and partner briefings so reviewers can trace every PTSD correlation to a documented study.
