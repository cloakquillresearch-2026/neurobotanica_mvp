## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0006] This invention relates to computational methodologies for botanical therapeutic discovery with integrated regulatory compliance support.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### 1. The Dimeric Cannabinoid Discovery Challenge

[0007] Recent peer-reviewed research has validated that rare dimeric cannabinoids possess therapeutic properties substantially superior to their parent monomeric compounds. Cannabizetol, a cannabigerol dimer discovered in September 2025 and characterized in the Journal of Natural Products, demonstrated enhanced anti-inflammatory activity through superior NF-κB pathway inhibition compared to cannabigerol monomer. This discovery validates the therapeutic potential of dimeric cannabinoid structures.

[0008] However, dimeric cannabinoids occur at natural concentrations below 0.1 percent in aged cannabis plant material, making extraction commercially infeasible. These compounds form through non-enzymatic oxidative processes during plant material aging, where methylene bridges link two cannabinoid molecules.

[0009] The specific conditions favoring dimeric formation, the range of possible dimeric structures from different parent cannabinoids, and the therapeutic properties of predicted dimers remain poorly characterized. Current approaches require synthesis-first methodologies where compounds must be physically created before any evaluation of therapeutic potential.

[0010] This creates substantial resource inefficiency, as researchers must synthesize dozens of dimeric candidates without prior knowledge of which structures will exhibit superior therapeutic properties or even whether predicted structures will be chemically stable and synthetically accessible.

[0011] No existing computational methodology enables prediction of which dimeric cannabinoid structures will form under specific oxidative aging conditions, what therapeutic properties those dimeric structures will exhibit, or how to prioritize synthesis efforts based on predicted therapeutic value and synthetic feasibility.

### 2. Traditional Knowledge and Dimeric Cannabinoid Formation

[0012] Many traditional cannabis preparation methods involve extended aging, curing, or oxidative processing of plant material. These traditional processes may concentrate dimeric cannabinoids through the same oxidative mechanisms that form methylene bridges.

[0013] Traditional knowledge holders developed these preparation methods over generations without access to modern analytical chemistry, yet their methods may have selected for processing conditions that favor therapeutically superior dimeric compound formation.

[0014] Integration of traditional knowledge into modern pharmaceutical research has historically occurred through extraction and appropriation rather than respectful partnership with fair compensation. No existing computational platform enforces free, prior, and informed consent before processing traditional botanical knowledge or provides automated benefit-sharing mechanisms when traditional knowledge contributes to commercial discoveries.

### 3. Schedule III Reclassification and FDA Regulatory Barriers

[0016] The pending reclassification of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act creates urgent need for FDA-compliant regulatory submission documentation. Schedule III classification requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to demonstrate safety and efficacy through FDA approval processes rather than operating under state-level medical cannabis programs.

[0017] Cannabis companies currently operating under state medical and recreational frameworks face imminent regulatory transition requiring:

- (a) Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) documentation detailing compound identification, quantification, and quality control processes
- (b) Pharmacology data packages demonstrating mechanism of action for specific cannabinoid compounds
- (c) Clinical efficacy evidence supporting therapeutic claims for approved medical conditions
- (d) Isolated compound characterization distinguishing therapeutic effects of individual cannabinoids from whole-plant preparations

[0018] Current research infrastructure has focused on whole-plant cannabis preparations suitable for Schedule I research exemptions but inadequate for Schedule III pharmaceutical approval. The transition to Schedule III creates demand for computational tools that can rapidly generate FDA-submission-ready documentation for cannabinoid compounds.

[0019] No existing computational platform provides integrated dimeric cannabinoid prediction with automated generation of regulatory documentation formatted for FDA submission requirements. Cannabis companies face choosing between expensive manual documentation processes or delayed market entry while building internal compliance capabilities.

### 4. Regulatory Research Barriers Under Current Schedule I Classification

[0020] Cannabis remains classified as Schedule I under current Controlled Substances Act regulations, creating severe research bottlenecks during the transition period before Schedule III implementation. Researchers face

twelve to eighteen month delays to obtain DEA licenses merely to possess cannabinoid reference standards for analytical work.

[0021] These delays prevent timely investigation of potentially therapeutic compounds and substantially increase research costs. Computational prediction methodologies that enable virtual screening before physical synthesis could reduce research timelines by identifying promising dimeric candidates before DEA license applications.

[0022] However, no existing system provides this computational research pathway for dimeric cannabinoid discovery integrated with regulatory compliance documentation generation.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0025] The present invention provides computational methodologies for predicting methylene-bridged dimeric cannabinoid formation with integrated traditional knowledge validation, consent-gated processing, and automated generation of FDA Schedule III regulatory compliance documentation.

[0026] The methodology enables researchers to computationally predict which dimeric structures will form under specified oxidative aging conditions, prioritize synthesis efforts based on predicted therapeutic value, generate documentation supporting FDA approval submissions, and ensure ethical traditional knowledge integration through automated consent enforcement and benefit-sharing execution.

[0027] The invention comprises five integrated methodological innovations described as follows.

### 1. Computational Dimeric Structure Prediction Methodology

[0028] The core methodology predicts methylene-bridged dimeric cannabinoid formation from parent cannabinoid molecular structures and oxidative aging condition parameters. The methodology employs graph-based analysis of parent cannabinoid molecular structures to identify reactive sites amenable to methylene bridge formation, calculates geometric compatibility through three-dimensional conformational analysis, models oxidative environment effects, and generates predicted homodimeric and heterodimeric structures with formation probability scores.

[0029] This methodology enables researchers to computationally screen thousands of potential dimeric structures before committing resources to physical compound creation.

### 2. Machine Learning Architecture for Prediction Refinement

[0030] The methodology incorporates supervised machine learning approaches that refine formation probability predictions as experimental validation data accumulate. Initial implementation employs gradient boosting decision trees suitable for small training datasets, with transition to neural network architectures as validation expands.

[0031] The machine learning framework includes uncertainty quantification providing confidence intervals, active learning strategies directing synthesis toward most informative predictions, and continuous model retraining triggered by data accumulation.

[0032] This adaptive learning enables systematic improvement from initial bootstrap models toward highly accurate predictions as experimental datasets expand.

### 3. FDA Schedule III Regulatory Compliance Support

[0033] The methodology generates documentation formatted for FDA regulatory submissions supporting Schedule III cannabis pharmaceutical approval. Compliance support capabilities include automated generation of Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls documentation, pharmacology data packages, comparative efficacy analysis, and quality control specifications.

[0034] This regulatory support addresses the urgent industry need created by Schedule III reclassification requiring FDA approval pathways for cannabis-derived therapeutics.

### 4. Consent-Gated Processing Integration

[0035] The methodology integrates with operational consent-gated infrastructure platforms to enforce traditional knowledge consent requirements. When dimeric cannabinoid research involves traditional preparation methods, the methodology validates community permissions through blockchain-verified consent artifacts before proceeding with computational analysis.

### 5. Traditional Knowledge Linkage and Automated Benefit-Sharing

[0036] The methodology identifies connections between traditional botanical preparation methods and dimeric cannabinoid formation. When traditional knowledge contributes to dimeric discoveries, the methodology generates cryptographically signed manifests documenting contributions and enables automated benefit-sharing execution through blockchain smart contracts.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### 1. System Architecture and Modular Design Philosophy

[0050] The computational methodology for dimeric cannabinoid prediction with FDA regulatory compliance support employs a modular architecture that separates system integration methodology (disclosed herein for patent protection) from proprietary analytical implementations (maintained as trade secrets accessed through application programming interfaces).

[0051] The modular design philosophy provides several strategic advantages for intellectual property protection and commercial competitiveness:

**Policy Orchestration Service:**

[0052] Coordinates consent validation across distributed systems. When botanical preparation methods reference traditional knowledge, the service queries consent registries to verify approved research purposes before allowing dimeric prediction analysis.

**Attribution Registry:**

[0053] Maintains immutable records linking traditional knowledge sources to dimeric cannabinoid predictions. Attribution metadata enables automated benefit-sharing when predictions lead to commercial products.

**Benefit-Sharing Execution Service:**

[0054] Calculates proportional compensation based on traditional knowledge contribution levels and executes cryptocurrency transfers via blockchain smart contracts.

**Consent Compilation Service:**

[0055] Validates traditional knowledge permissions by querying distributed consent artifacts. Returns authorization status with cryptographic proof of consent validity or denial.

**Policy Orchestration Service (Detailed):**

[0056] The policy orchestration service enforces consent requirements at the integration layer, coordinating authorization checks across prediction workflow stages. When traditional preparation methods reference traditional knowledge, consent validation occurs before computational analysis proceeds.

### 1.1 Modular Architecture Rationale

[0061] The methodology identifies three layers in the system architecture:

**Infrastructure Layer (Operational):**

Provides cryptographic authentication using RSA-4096 and ECDSA-P384 standards, distributed policy orchestration with sub-two-second halt propagation, blockchain-based attribution via immutable ledgers, and automated benefit-sharing through smart contracts.

**Methodology Layer (Patent-Protected):**

Defines computational workflows for dimeric structure prediction, traditional knowledge consent validation, automated benefit-sharing execution, and regulatory documentation generation.

**Implementation Layer (Trade Secrets):**

Contains proprietary algorithms for formation probability scoring, machine learning model architectures, regulatory template generation, and optimization strategies accessed exclusively through APIs.

### 2. Core Dimeric Cannabinoid Prediction Methodology

[0070] The core methodology predicts methylene-bridged dimeric cannabinoid formation from parent cannabinoid structures. This section describes the computational workflow enabling researchers to identify promising dimeric synthesis candidates without physical compound creation.

### 2.1 Parent Cannabinoid Structure Representation

[0071] The methodology accepts parent cannabinoid molecular structures as input using standard molecular representation formats including SMILES strings, InChI identifiers, or SDF structure files. Input validation confirms molecular structure integrity before proceeding with dimeric prediction analysis.

### 2.2 Graph-Based Reactive Site Identification

[0080] The methodology converts parent cannabinoid structures to graph-based molecular representations where nodes represent atoms and edges represent chemical bonds. Graph traversal algorithms identify reactive sites amenable to methylene bridge formation based on local chemical environment analysis.

Reactive site identification considers:

- Hydroxyl groups at aromatic ring positions
- Electron-donating substituents increasing nucleophilicity
- Steric accessibility for methylene bridge attachment
- Resonance stabilization after bridge formation

### 2.3 Geometric Compatibility Assessment

[0090] For identified reactive site pairs, the methodology calculates geometric compatibility for methylene bridge formation. Three-dimensional conformational analysis generates low-energy conformers for parent cannabinoids and evaluates spatial positioning enabling bridge formation.

Geometric compatibility assessment includes:

- Distance between reactive sites (optimal 3–5 Å)
- Angular alignment favoring bridge formation
- Conformational flexibility enabling reactive site approach
- Steric hindrance from neighboring functional groups

### 2.4 Oxidative Environment Modeling

[0098] The methodology models oxidative aging conditions affecting dimeric cannabinoid formation probability. Environmental parameters include temperature, oxygen concentration, light exposure, and aging duration. The model predicts formation kinetics under specified conditions.

### 2.5 Machine Learning Refinement

[0106] The methodology incorporates machine learning models that refine formation probability predictions as experimental validation data accumulate. Bootstrap training uses three characterized dimeric cannabinoids (cannabizetol, cannabidiolic acid dimer CBD-C3, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid dimer THC-C2) as reference standards.

Machine learning architecture employs:

- Gradient boosting decision trees for small training datasets (< 10 characterized dimers)
- Neural network architectures for expanded datasets (> 10 characterized dimers)
- Uncertainty quantification providing confidence intervals
- Active learning directing synthesis validation toward informative predictions

### 2.6 Formation Probability Scoring

[0116] The methodology assigns formation probability scores to predicted dimeric structures integrating reactive site favorability, geometric compatibility, oxidative environment modeling, and machine learning refinement. Probability scores enable synthesis prioritization.

### 2.7 Predictive Model Validation

[0128] The methodology validates predictive models using three characterized dimeric cannabinoids as reference standards. Validation metrics include:

- Prediction accuracy for known dimeric structures
- Calibration of probability scores against experimental outcomes
- Systematic bias detection and correction
- Cross-validation stability across training subsets

Expanded validation will occur as predicted structures are synthesized and characterized, with continuous model refinement improving accuracy.

### 3. FDA Schedule III Compliance Support

[0133] The methodology generates documentation formatted for FDA regulatory submissions supporting Schedule III cannabis pharmaceutical approval.

### 3.1 Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls Documentation

[0141] Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) documentation describes molecular characterization, manufacturing processes, quality control specifications, and analytical methods for dimeric cannabinoid therapeutics.

CMC documentation includes:

- Molecular structure diagrams and physicochemical properties
- Synthesis pathway descriptions and reaction conditions
- Analytical method validation for identity and purity testing
- Stability data under proposed storage conditions
- Batch release specifications and acceptance criteria

### 3.2 Pharmacology Data Packages

[0151] Pharmacology data packages demonstrate therapeutic mechanisms and comparative efficacy for predicted dimeric cannabinoids. Packages include mechanism-of-action descriptions, target receptor binding profiles, pharmacokinetic parameter predictions, and comparative efficacy analysis versus parent monomeric cannabinoids.

### 4. Consent-Gated Processing

[0168] The methodology integrates with operational consent-gated infrastructure platforms to enforce traditional knowledge consent requirements before processing botanical preparation methods.

### 4.1 Traditional Knowledge Detection

[0177] Traditional knowledge detection identifies preparation methods referencing traditional botanical practices. Detection triggers consent validation before proceeding with dimeric cannabinoid analysis.

### 4.2 Consent Validation Integration

[0188] When traditional knowledge is detected, the methodology queries consent compilation services to validate community permissions. Consent validation confirms approved research purposes, temporal validity, and authorized users before analysis proceeds.

### 5. Traditional Knowledge Attribution and Benefit-Sharing

[0195] The methodology identifies connections between traditional preparation methods and dimeric cannabinoid formation, enabling attribution tracking and automated benefit-sharing when traditional knowledge contributes to commercial discoveries.

### 5.1 Traditional Knowledge Linkage

[0207] Traditional knowledge linkage extracts oxidative processing parameters from preparation method descriptions and maps parameters to dimeric formation probability models, identifying methods likely to concentrate dimeric cannabinoids.

### 5.2 Attribution Manifest Generation

[0219] Attribution manifests document traditional knowledge contributions to dimeric cannabinoid predictions using cryptographically signed records stored on immutable blockchain ledgers.

### 5.3 Automated Benefit-Sharing Execution

[0233] Automated benefit-sharing executes proportional compensation when traditional knowledge contributes to commercially successful dimeric cannabinoid products. Benefit-sharing distribution occurs via cryptocurrency smart contracts with cryptographically signed payment receipts.

### 6. Modular Analytical Processing Architecture
